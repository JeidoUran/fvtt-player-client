## Discord Rich Presence

In order to enable and use Rich Presence, you also need to have the Module [Foundry VTT Rich Presence](https://github.com/JeidoUran/fvtt-rich-presence) installed and enabled on each World you want to use it with. Furthermore, you need to enable the option **Enable Discord Rich Presence** in both the **Client Configuration** and the **Module Settings**, as it is off by default.

## Customization

You can pre-configure and customize the client by editing the `config.json` file.
From where the executable is located,
you can find the `config.json` file by navigating to the `resources/app` folder.
You can edit the file with any text editor.

Example config:

```json
{
  "games": [
    {
      "name": "This is the name of my game",
      "url": "https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch"
    }
  ],
  "background": "https://images2.alphacoders.com/123/123862.jpg",
  "backgroundColor": "#000000",
  "textColor": "white",
  "accentColor": "green"
}
```

## Getting data from `localStorage` to put into `config.json`

```js
JSON.stringify({
    ...JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem("appConfig") || "{}"),
    games: JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem("gameList") || "[]")
})
```

Special thanks to theripper93 and OmegaRogue for creating this client. I am no developper and without their amazing work it would have been impossible to start this project.
