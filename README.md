## Discord Rich Presence

In order to enable and use Rich Presence, you also need to have the module [Foundry VTT Rich Presence](https://github.com/JeidoUran/fvtt-rich-presence) installed and enabled on each world you want to use it with. Furthermore, you need to enable the option **Enable Discord Rich Presence** in both the **Client Configuration** and the **Module Settings**, as it is off by default.

## Customization

A new theme, "Codex", has been added. It was made after my campaign's website, while keeping general usability in mind. That being said, users who prefer the original theme can find it in the **Client Configuration**, under **Theme**. I made sure to keep it as simple and lightweight as possible while integrating the new features. You may also disable the particles floating in the background. For now, "Codex" and "Original" are the only themes available, but I am considering adding more ways to customise them on top of what's currently available.

Special thanks to theripper93 and OmegaRogue for creating this client. I am no developper and without their amazing work it would have been impossible to make those updates.
